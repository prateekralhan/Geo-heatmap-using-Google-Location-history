# Geo-heatmap-using-Google-Location-history

"Google is tracking all of us.."

Let us find out ourselves.

## Installation:
Install Dependencies by running the command : ***pip install -r requirements.txt***

## Usage: 
1. Go to [Google Takeout](https://takeout.google.com/settings/takeout?pli=1) to download your location data. 
2. De-select everything and then check **Location History â€” JSON format**. 
3. Download your data as a zip archive, then unzip it. You should now have a JSON file on your computer that contains every instance of when your phone stored your location (which, if you have location services enabled, happens more often than you might think). Be aware that all of this might take a little while depending on how much data there is about you. I had it in GBs :astonished: !!
